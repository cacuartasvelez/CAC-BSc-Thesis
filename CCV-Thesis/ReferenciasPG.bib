  abstract = {Phase diversity is a phase-retrieval algorithm that uses a pair of intensity images taken symmetrically about the wave front to be determined. If these images are taken about the system input pupil this is equivalent to a curvature-sensing algorithm. Traditionally a defocus aberration kernel is used to produce the phase-diverse data. We present a generalization of this method to allow the use of other functions as the diversity kernel. We discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions that such a function must satisfy for use in a null wave-front sensor. Computer simulations were used to validate these results.},

The analysis applies to arbitrary grating profiles, groove depths, angles of incidence, and wavelengths. Example results for a wide range of groove depths are presented for sinusoidal, square-wave triangular, and sawtooth gratings. Diffraction efficiencies obtained from the present method of analysis are compared with previously published numerical results. To obtain large diffraction efficiencies (greater than 85\%) for gratings with typical substrate perinittivities, it is shown that the grating profile should possess even symmetry.},

  abstract = {Wavefront sensing by phase retrieval implies extraction of the Fourier transform of a complex signal based on observation of the modulus of the signal. Only the image intensity from a system's focal plane array is required to estimate the phase aberrations. These estimates are used to derive control signals to align (or to maintain alignment of) the optical system. The concept can be used in both a predetection and postdetection mode. In the former, the control system labors to keep the optics in a diffraction-limited mode all the time. In the latter, the control system induces a phase or wavelength diversity that allows successive images to be restored to nearly diffraction-limited quality by postprocessing of the image. This second mode is particularly interesting because it will reduce the design effort for both the optical system and the control system. How the phase or wavelength diversity is achieved is not clear at this time. If the method has utility, it provides an interesting challenge to designers of optical devices. In this paper we describe the mathematics of the technique and show some computer simulations which involve both point sources and extended objects.},

  abstract = {The erythrocruorin of the leech Haemopis grandis possessed an S20,w of 57 S at neutral pH, its isoelectric point at pH 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and P50 = 11.2 mm at pH 7.4. A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight \%, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.},

These static aberrations are unseen by the wave front sensor and therefore not corrected in closed loop. We present experimental results validating new procedures of measurement and pre-compensation of the NCPA on the AO bench at ONERA. The measurement procedure is based on new refined algorithms of phase diversity. The pre-compensation procedure makes use of a pseudo-closed loop scheme to overcome the AO wavefront sensor model uncertainties. Strehl Ratio obtained in the images reaches 98.7\% @ 632.8 nm. This result allows us to be confident of achieving the challenging performance required for extrasolar planet direct observation.},

(2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD. (3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride.},

Processing speed, which will be important for real-time wave-front control applications, can be enhanced by use of small-format detectors with pixels that do not fully sample the diffraction limit. Using an object-independent phase-diversity algorithm, we show that, for both pointlike and extended objects, the fidelity of the phase and amplitude estimates degrades gracefully, rather than catastrophically, as the sampling becomes coarser. We show in simulation that the same algorithm also improves the fidelity of image reconstruction of complex targets.},

Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input{\textendash}output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

  issn = {0365-0138},
  url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A\%26AS..107..243L},
  abstract = {We have implemented a least-squares technique for recovering phase 
information from simultaneously recorded focused and defocused images.
The inversions are made from small subfields in order to deal with
anisoplanatic image formation, such as occurring through the Earth's
atmosphere. Parameters corresponding to the alignment of the
focused-defocused images are determined simultaneously with aberration
parameters. Simulations show that the method can recover wavefronts of
up to 1/2 wave rms and that 15-21 Zernike coefficients can be obtained
from 3"x3"-5"x5" solar granulation images using a 50 cm telescope and
with noise levels of 0.4\% of the average intensity. In general, the
accuracy of the restored images is better than expected from the number
of Zernike polynomials used to represent the wave front. We have applied
the method to sequences of 100 8-bit solar granulation images obtained
with the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope (SVST) in La Palma using
subfields of 3"x3"-5"x5". These data enable a number of consistency
tests, all of which demonstrate that the technique works on real data.
Using averaged images obtained from each sequence we find that derived
alignment parameters are consistent to within 0.02" and that wavefronts
derived from different subfields and different sequences recorded close
in time are virtually identical. The wavefronts derived from averaged
images are also virtually identical to the average of wavefronts derived
from individual images. These measurements of telescope aberrations
suggest that astigmatism and coma are the major aberrations. These
aberrations vary with time in a way which is consistent with a major
contribution from the telescope objective and/or the first folding
mirror of the alt-az tower telescope. Wavefronts derived from individual
images show 50-90\% correlation between Zernike coefficients 4-14 derived
from nearby but independent subfields. Mosaics of 13 x 11 independently
derived wavefronts from single images show smooth variations across a
12"x10" field-of-view. These results are consistent with the impression
that degradation of image quality is more or less uniform across the
image. Restored images in a sequence show a high degree of consistency
and much more fine structure than the corresponding observed images, but
occasional fringe-like artifacts can be seen. Using the results of two
inversions to restore the scene removes such artifacts. We conclude that
this technique provides adequate wavefront information on telescopic and
atmospheric wavefront aberrations and substantial improvements in image
quality. The ease of implementation as well as its tolerance to
experimental errors and low cost makes it an excellent complement to or
even substitute for adaptive optics for many applications. The technique
is particularly well-suited for solar telescopes, where wavefront
sensing over a large field-of-view is important.},

  title = {Improvement of the performance of the twisted-nematic liquid-crystal display as a phase modulator},
  volume = {50},
  issn = {1539-4522},
  abstract = {A twisted-nematic liquid-crystal display (TN-LCD) placed between two linear polarizers (P) generally produces coupled intensity and phase modulations. For the purpose of phase-only modulation, quarter-wave plates (QWPs) are often used in front of or behind the LCD. In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the QWPs' effect on the modulation properties of the TN-LCD based on the general Jones matrix descriptions for all the devices, which circumvents the inconvenience of the traditional method on the basis of the TN-LCD's internal parameters. We prove that the phase modulation depth of the TN-LCD can be further increased in the configuration of P1-QWP1-LCD-QWP2-P2 with each component properly oriented, provided that the mean intensity transmission is decreased to a lower level. By observing the diffracted patterns of the Ronchi phase grating or blazed grating addressed onto the TN-LCD, we verify the validity of the proposed method. Improved reconstructed image quality from the kinoform loaded on the TN-LCD is obtained in this configuration. This approach is valuable when the TN-LCD is employed as a phase modulator, especially for the modern, thinner TN-LCD.},
